# VITAL Recco System (ML project)
 This is healthcare focused website of python , machine learning.
 VitalRecco â€“ Health Recommendation System
Technologies: **Python, Machine Learning (SVC), Flask, SQLite3
**
Description:
VitalRecco is an intelligent health recommendation system developed using Python and machine learning. The project uses the Support Vector Classifier (SVC) model to predict possible diseases based on user-input symptoms. It then provides personalized recommendations, including suggested precautions and medications.

The application features a Flask-based web interface for smooth user interaction and integrates with an SQLite3 database to securely store user data and feedback. The system emphasizes real-time prediction accuracy and aims to assist users in early symptom analysis and guidance before clinical consultation.

Key Features:

Symptom-based disease prediction using SVC.

User-friendly web interface with Flask.

Lightweight database integration using SQLite3.

Real-time health suggestions (precautions, medications, etc.).

This project demonstrates a practical application of machine learning in healthcare and highlights full-stack integration, data handling, and user-focused design.
